Here are the points, that I have to figure out in Drupal:

-> Where are Pictures (jpg, and possible files like pdf) stored?

     They are Stored in /var/www/html/mysite/sites/default/files/


-> Revision of Project / Backups:

     You can just make a git repository of /var/www/html/mysite/sites/
     There is already a .gitignore file that excludes the "files"
     folder from being tracked. Not many changes are made here,
     howewer. Most of the configurations and content is stored in the
     database.

     To make a backup of the database you can use drush:
     ~$ drush cc all
     ~$ drush sql-dump --ordered-dump > ~/my-sql-dump-file-name.sql

     The first line clears the caches of drupal and the second one
     dumps the database into the given sql-file.

     Now to import the sql file you have to use the following
     commands:
     ~$ drush sql-drop           # this deletes the current drupal
                                 # database
     ~$ drush sql-cli < /path/to/my-sql-dump-file-name.sql

     voila.

-> Revision of Content in Drupal:

   After creation our content can be changed. We want to keep track of
   these changes. Firstly you can turn on revisioning for a content
   type in structure > content types > mycontent > (edit) > publishing
   options. This way the system keeps revisioning snapshots of the
   content each time it is updated.

   Then there is a Module named Diff, which shows differcneces between
   revision snapshots as a normal text diff.


-> Installing Drush:

   https://www.drupal.org/project/drush


-> Setting up Drupal with drush

   set up mysql user and database:
   ~$ mysql -u root -p
   mysql> CREATE USER 'wernerheisenberg'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'iwouldnevertortureacat';
   mysql> CREATE DATABASE loopedia_drupal_test;
   mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON loopedia_drupal_test.* TO 'wernerheisenberg'@'localhost';
   mysql> exit;
   ~$ cd /to/your/site/
   ~$ drush dl drupal-7.x
   ~$ (rename generated drupal-7.x_dev/ folder into loopedia/)
   in browser: localhost/loopedia -> rest of configuration


-> What fields should my content type "integral" store?




2016-01-14: I used the drupal module "features" to define a custom node
type and export it to a module. This module is in
/drupal/modules/integral_feature.

I also copied the node example module from the examples-module to
/doc/drupal/node_example_original/


2016-02-24; The search for a drupal search module goes on. As a backend,
I decided to use "Solr", a search engine (backend) developed by apache.
This is open source and seems to be very powerful because it is made for
large sites with a lot of traffic. And I chose the drupal module Search
API as the search module. They are often used together by many sites and
are both well maintained. Here one comparison:
http://drupal.stackexchange.com/questions/15508/search-api-vs-apache-solr-search-integration-in-drupal-7

Interesting websites for Search API:
https://www.drupal.org/project/search_api_solr
https://www.drupal.org/node/1999262

For the installation of Solr I pretty much used this guide:
(https://www.drupal.org/node/2502221)  It is straight forward. Only the
automatic start as a service, I did not managed to do. Also, on the real
server we have to restrict access to the solr web interface and server.


2016-03-02 Drupal on virtual Suse:
- Install Opensuse on virtual machine and make an update
- Install apache2
- Configure apache2 through Yast: "HTTP Server"

The problem of yesterday was that the server gave a permission error
site. I used soft links to link from the /srv/www/htdocs/ folder to the
drupal folder in my home directory. Apparently apache2 is configured to
not follow symlinks. I copied the drupal folder into /srv/www/htdocs/
and now it works!
