Here are the points, that I have to figure out in Drupal:

-> Where are Pictures (jpg, and possible files like pdf) stored?

     They are Stored in /var/www/html/mysite/sites/default/files/


-> Revision of Project / Backups:

     You can just make a git repository of /var/www/html/mysite/sites/
     There is already a .gitignore file that excludes the "files"
     folder from being tracked. Not many changes are made here,
     howewer. Most of the configurations and content is stored in the
     database.

     To make a backup of the database you can use drush:
     ~$ drush cc all  
     ~$ drush sql-dump --ordered-dump > ~/my-sql-dump-file-name.sql    

     The first line clears the caches of drupal and the second one
     dumps the database into the given sql-file.

     Now to import the sql file you have to use the following
     commands:
     ~$ drush sql-drop           # this deletes the current drupal 
                                 # database
     ~$ drush sql-cli < /path/to/my-sql-dump-file-name.sql

     voila.

-> Revision of Content in Drupal:

   After creation our content can be changed. We want to keep track of
   these changes. Firstly you can turn on revisioning for a content
   type in structure > content types > mycontent > (edit) > publishing
   options. This way the system keeps revisioning snapshots of the
   content each time it is updated.

   Then there is a Module named Diff, which shows differcneces between
   revision snapshots as a normal text diff.


-> Installing Drush:

   https://www.drupal.org/project/drush   


-> Setting up Drupal with drush
   
   set up mysql user and database:
   ~$ mysql -u root -p
   mysql> CREATE USER 'wernerheisenberg'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'iwouldnevertortureacat';
   mysql> CREATE DATABASE loopedia_drupal_test;
   mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON loopedia_drupal_test.* TO 'wernerheisenberg'@'localhost';
   mysql> exit;
   ~$ cd /to/your/site/
   ~$ drush dl drupal-7.x
   ~$ (rename generated drupal-7.x_dev/ folder into loopedia/)
   in browser: localhost/loopedia -> rest of configuration


-> What fields should my content type "integral" store?
